# GDV Engine

GDV Engine is a graphics engine under development for the creation of 3D graphics. This project is focused on combining the power of C++ and OpenGL with a cross-platform graphics editor developed in C# using Uno Platform.

## Project Vision

GDV Engine aims to become a complete and accessible tool for game and graphics application developers. As it evolves, we plan to include:

-   Dynamic shadows and advanced lighting systems.
-   Physics-based rendering (PBR).
-   Support for animations and physics.
-   Project export to multiple platforms.
-   An active community for extensions and add-ons.
